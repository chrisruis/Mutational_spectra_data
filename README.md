Data and scripts used in "Mutational spectra analysis reveals bacterial niche and transmission routes"

# data
This directory contains data used in the manuscript

##Â mutational\_spectra directory
Contains variable sites alignments, phylogenetic trees, position conversion files, reference genomes and rescaled mutational spectra for the 84 clade datasets

Directories are named to match the clade name in all\_SBS\_spectra.csv (Table Sx in the manuscript)

Alignments and phylogenetic trees are named to match the directory name. Position conversion files are named conversion.txt. Mutational spectra are named with the directory name followed by \_SBS\_spectrum.csv

Where clades were labelled to separate branches into groups (e.g. to remove hypermutator branches), the labelled trees are included with suffix \_labelled.nwk

SBS spectra were calculated separately for three _B. cenocepacia_ epidemic clones and combined to form a single SBS spectrum for further analysis. Alignments, phylogenetic trees and labelled trees are provided for each epidemic clone. The combined SBS spectrum is in the B\_cenocepacia\_ECs directory. The same conversion.txt file was used for each epidemic clone
